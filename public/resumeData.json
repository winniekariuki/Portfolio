I worked on several features as a front end engineer. They include, the designing of the Asset History and Asset Repair Log, displaying the actual data of asset history and repair log, editing of asset categories and subcategories, writing integrated tests for the creation of asset categories, fixing smart bugs, etc. Working in Activo gave me the experience and skills of delivering high-quality code while working and collaborating in the large engineering team. I was also part of a team that worked on a project called Author's Haven that included a platform that would allow users to write articles, read the articles and follow one another. I worked as both front end engineer and back end engineer. In this project, I got experience in working with restful API and Postgres as a backend developer."
